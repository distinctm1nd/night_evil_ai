# Night of the Evil AI Minibadge Expansion Board Instructions

<img src="night_evil_ai_minibadges.png" width="800" />

For the board itself, solder the minibadge headers and the SAO connectors. The SAO connector key should face up (See image).
This badge runs best with USB power although it will work with batteries. 

I recommend putting hot glue over the LEDs / mask area on the minibadges for better diffusion of light.

- R1, R2, R3, R4: Solder 68 ohm resistors (1206), orientation doesn't matter
- D1, D2, D3, D4: Solder red LEDS (1206). Make sure that orientation is as marked.
