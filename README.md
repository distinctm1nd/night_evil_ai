# Night of the Evil AI Minibadge Expansion Board Instructions

<img src="night_evil_ai_minibadges.png" width="800" />

For the board itself, solder the minibadge headers and the SAO connectors. The SAO connector key should face up (See image).
This badge runs best with USB power although it will work with batteries. 

I recommend putting hot glue over the LEDs / mask area on the minibadges for better diffusion of light. 




## They Won't Stay Dead Minibadge

- This badge has an eeprom that is not used. You can optionally solder it.
- R1, R2, R3, R4: Solder 68 ohm resistors (1206), orientation doesn't matter
- D1, D2, D3, D4: Solder red LEDS (1206). Make sure that orientation is as marked.

## Bottom Tombstone Minibadge

  - R1, R3: 15 ohm resistors (1206), orientation doesn't matter.
  - D3: Blue LED (1206), marked blue.
  - D1, D2, D4: UV LEDs (1206), unmarked.
  - Select either blink or normal.
 
  ## Left Eye Minibadge

  - R1, R2, R3, R4: 68 ohms (1206), marked yellow
  - D1, D3, D4: Yellow LEDs (1206), marked yellow
  - D2: Green LED (1206), marked green
  - The eeprom is not used. 

## Right Bottom Eye Minibadge

- R1, R3: 68 ohm (1206)
- D1, D3: Blue LEDs (1206), marked blue. Note that the marking for D3 is slightly above it. D3 is under D1. The cathode mark for D1 and D3 are hard to see. They are both on the left side. 
- D2, D4: Green LEDs (1206), marked green. The cathode mark for D2 and D4 is hard to see. They are both on the left side.


## Right Eye Minibadge

- The eeprom is not used.
- R1, R2, R3, R5: 68 ohm (0603)
- D1, D2, D3, D14, D15, D16: These are either be red or yellow LEDs (0603). They are marked with respective color
- D4, D5, D6, D7, D8, D9, D10, D11, D12, D13: These are either red or yellow LEDs (0201). You can't see the polarity markings on these. The marking (cathode) is on the left side of all of them.
- Pin 1 is marked for CD4017.

## Tombstone Minibadge

- R1, R2, R3, R4: 68 ohm (1206)
- D1, D2, D3, D4: yellow-green LEDs (1206)

## Tree Minibadge

- The eeprom is not used. 
- R1, R2: 68 ohm resistors (1206)
- D1, D2: Yellow LEDs (1206), marked yellow. The cathode mark on some of the LEDs is hard to see. It is on the left side for all of them. 
- D3, D4: Green LEDs (1206), marked green.  The cathode mark on some of the LEDs is hard to see. It is on the left side for all of them.
